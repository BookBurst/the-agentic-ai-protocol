# The Agentic AI Protocol - Official Blueprints

Welcome, Architect. 

This is the official repository for the book **"The Agentic AI Protocol"**. This archive contains the high-level "floor plans" (code and architectural schemas) required to build 24/7 autonomous digital workforces.

## 🛠 How to Use These Blueprints
You are the Architect, not the typist. Follow these steps to deploy your agents:

1. **Locate the Module:** Open the folder corresponding to the chapter you are currently reading.
2. **Copy the Code:** Select the code block you need.
3. **The Execution Hack:** Paste the code into ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude using the "Beginner Prompt" found on the second page of the book.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The archive follows the **S.C.A.L.E.** Protocol:
* `setup/`: Initial requirements and environment installation.
* `module-1` to `module-5`: The core S.C.A.L.E. framework (Structure, Connection, Archiving, Limits, Evolution).
* `module-6` to `module-8`: Deployment, Troubleshooting, and Production Blueprints.
* `evergreen-protocol/`: Long-term maintenance and system stability.

## ⚠️ Security & Configuration
Before executing any script, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and insert your personal API keys. **Never share your real .env file publicly.**
