# Agentic AI Architectural Patterns - Official Blueprints

Welcome. 

This is the official repository for the book **"Agentic AI Architectural Patterns"**. This archive contains the high-level "floor plans" (code and architectural schemas) required to build 24/7 autonomous digital workforces.

## 🛠 How to Use These Blueprints
You are the Architect, not the typist. Follow these steps to deploy your agents:

1. **Locate the Module:** Open the folder corresponding to the chapter you are currently reading.
2. **Copy the Code:** Select the code block you need.
3. **The Execution Hack:** Paste the code into ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude using the "Beginner Prompt" found on the second page of the book.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The archive follows the **Evergreen Protocol**:
* `module-1-structure`: Building the core agentic loop.
* `module-2-connection`: Linking agents to the real world (MCP, Tools).
* `module-3-archiving`: Managing vector memory and RAG.
* `module-4-limits`: Cost control and safety boundaries.
* `module-5-evolution`: Monitoring, A/B testing, and optimization.
* `module-6-deployment`: Production, Docker, and Cloud.
* `module-7-troubleshooting`: Resilience, retries, and logic interceptors.
* `module-8-blueprints`: Ready-to-use project templates.
* `module-9-evergreen`: The final agnostic architecture.
* `conclusion`: The Architect's final pre-flight checklist.

## ⚠️ Security & Configuration
Before executing any script, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and insert your personal API keys. **Never share your real .env file publicly.**
